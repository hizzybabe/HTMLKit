**Chapter 4: Loops in Python**

### Topics

#### 4.1 for and while Loops
   - **for Loop**:
      - **Explanation**: Introduce the `for` loop, which iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or range).
      - **Example**: Show examples of looping through a list of items and using the `range()` function.
      - **Syntax**:
        ```python
        for i in range(5):
            print(i)
        ```
   - **while Loop**:
      - **Explanation**: Introduce the `while` loop, which continues as long as a given condition is true.
      - **Example**: Show a basic example where the `while` loop runs until a certain condition is no longer met.
      - **Syntax**:
        ```python
        count = 0
        while count < 5:
            print(count)
            count += 1
        ```

#### 4.2 Nested Loops
   - **Explanation**: Explain that loops can be nested within other loops and show how nested loops are useful for handling multi-dimensional data structures, such as matrices.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     for i in range(3):
         for j in range(3):
             print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
     ```

#### 4.3 Loop Control Statements
   - **break**: Explain the `break` statement, which stops the loop entirely when encountered.
   - **continue**: Explain the `continue` statement, which skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
   - **Example**:
     ```python
     for i in range(5):
         if i == 3:
             break
         print(i)  # Will print numbers until it reaches 3 and then stop
     ```

#### Write a Program that Prints a Multiplication Table for a Given Number

- **Objective**: Create a program that takes a number as input and prints its multiplication table up to a specified range (e.g., 1 to 10).
- **Instructions**:
   1. **Get User Input**:
      - Create a Python file (e.g., `multiplication_table.py`).
      - Use `input()` to ask the user for a number and convert it to an integer.
      - Example:
        ```python
        number = int(input("Enter a number for its multiplication table: "))
        ```
   2. **Print the Multiplication Table**:
      - Use a `for` loop to iterate through a range (e.g., 1 to 10) and print the product of the number and each iteration.
      - Example:
        ```python
        for i in range(1, 11):
            print(f"{number} x {i} = {number * i}")
        ```
   3. **Test the Program**: Run the program and try different numbers to verify it prints correct multiplication tables.

**Project: Create a "Countdown Timer"**

- **Description**: The Countdown Timer program will take the userâ€™s input for the number of seconds and then count down to zero, printing the remaining time at each second.

- **Objective**: Use a `while` loop to implement a countdown and introduce learners to the `time.sleep()` function for delaying execution.

- **Instructions**:
   1. **Get User Input**:
      - Create a Python file (e.g., `countdown_timer.py`).
      - Use `input()` to ask the user for the number of seconds for the countdown and convert it to an integer.
      - Example:
        ```python
        import time
        seconds = int(input("Enter the number of seconds for the countdown: "))
        ```

   2. **Implement the Countdown**:
      - Use a `while` loop to count down from the entered number to zero.
      - Inside the loop, print the current seconds remaining, subtract one from the counter, and use `time.sleep(1)` to wait one second between each print.
      - Example:
        ```python
        while seconds > 0:
            print(f"Time left: {seconds} seconds")
            seconds -= 1
            time.sleep(1)
        print("Countdown finished!")
        ```

   3. **Test the Timer**:
      - Run the timer with different countdown lengths to verify that it correctly counts down and ends.

This chapter introduces learners to essential loop structures in Python. The multiplication table exercise helps solidify the `for` loop, while the countdown project reinforces the `while` loop with a practical example. By the end, learners will have a firm understanding of using loops and controlling their flow with `break` and `continue` statements.
