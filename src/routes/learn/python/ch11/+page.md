**Chapter 11: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

### Topics

#### 11.1 Classes, Objects, and Methods
   - **Classes**:
      - Define a class as a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating data (attributes) and functions (methods) related to that data.
      - **Syntax**:
        ```python
        class ClassName:
            # Class definition
        ```
   - **Objects**:
      - Explain that an object is an instance of a class with specific attribute values.
      - **Creating an Object**:
        ```python
        car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
        ```
   - **Methods**:
      - Define methods as functions within a class that operate on objects.
      - Explain how to define methods with `self` as the first parameter, representing the instance.
      - **Example**:
        ```python
        class Car:
            def start(self):
                print("Car is starting.")
        ```

#### 11.2 Constructors, Inheritance, and Encapsulation
   - **Constructors (`__init__` Method)**:
      - Introduce the constructor (`__init__` method) to initialize object attributes when an object is created.
      - **Example**:
        ```python
        class Car:
            def __init__(self, make, model, year):
                self.make = make
                self.model = model
                self.year = year
        ```
   - **Inheritance**:
      - Explain inheritance as a mechanism to create a new class from an existing class, allowing the new class to inherit methods and attributes.
      - **Example**:
        ```python
        class ElectricCar(Car):
            def __init__(self, make, model, year, battery_size):
                super().__init__(make, model, year)
                self.battery_size = battery_size
        ```
   - **Encapsulation**:
      - Define encapsulation as the practice of keeping data and methods private to control access.
      - Explain the use of private attributes with a single underscore (`_attribute`) or double underscores (`__attribute`) for name mangling.
      - **Example**:
        ```python
        class Car:
            def __init__(self, make, model, year):
                self._make = make  # protected attribute
        ```

### Workshop Exercise

#### Create a Class `Car` with Attributes and Display Details

- **Objective**: Create a `Car` class with attributes for make, model, and year. Write a method to display these details.
- **Instructions**:
   1. **Define the `Car` Class**:
      - Create a Python file (e.g., `car.py`).
      - Define the `Car` class with `make`, `model`, and `year` attributes.
      - Example:
        ```python
        class Car:
            def __init__(self, make, model, year):
                self.make = make
                self.model = model
                self.year = year
        ```

   2. **Define a Method to Display Details**:
      - Create a `display_info` method to print the carâ€™s details.
      - Example:
        ```python
            def display_info(self):
                print(f"Car: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")
        ```

   3. **Create and Test an Object**:
      - Create an instance of the `Car` class and call `display_info` to display its details.
      - Example:
        ```python
        car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020)
        car.display_info()  # Outputs: Car: 2020 Toyota Corolla
        ```

### Chapter Project

**Project: Build a "Library System"**

- **Description**: The Library System will allow users to borrow, return, and view available books. Each book will have a title, author, and status (available or borrowed).

- **Objective**: Use classes, objects, and methods to build a simple library system, implementing concepts like constructors, encapsulation, and inheritance.

- **Instructions**:
   1. **Define the `Book` Class**:
      - Create a Python file (e.g., `library_system.py`).
      - Define the `Book` class with attributes for `title`, `author`, and `is_borrowed`.
      - Include a method to display book details and a method to check its status.
      - Example:
        ```python
        class Book:
            def __init__(self, title, author):
                self.title = title
                self.author = author
                self.is_borrowed = False

            def display_info(self):
                status = "Available" if not self.is_borrowed else "Borrowed"
                print(f"Title: {self.title}, Author: {self.author}, Status: {status}")
        ```

   2. **Define the `Library` Class**:
      - Create a `Library` class to manage a collection of `Book` objects.
      - Add methods to:
         - Add a book.
         - Borrow a book.
         - Return a book.
         - Display all available books.
      - Example:
        ```python
        class Library:
            def __init__(self):
                self.books = []

            def add_book(self, book):
                self.books.append(book)
                print(f"Added book: {book.title}")

            def borrow_book(self, title):
                for book in self.books:
                    if book.title == title and not book.is_borrowed:
                        book.is_borrowed = True
                        print(f"You have borrowed '{title}'")
                        return
                print(f"Sorry, '{title}' is not available.")

            def return_book(self, title):
                for book in self.books:
                    if book.title == title and book.is_borrowed:
                        book.is_borrowed = False
                        print(f"You have returned '{title}'")
                        return
                print(f"'{title}' was not borrowed from this library.")

            def display_available_books(self):
                print("Available Books:")
                for book in self.books:
                    if not book.is_borrowed:
                        book.display_info()
        ```

   3. **Test the Library System**:
      - Create an instance of the `Library` class and add books to it.
      - Test borrowing, returning, and displaying available books.
      - Example:
        ```python
        library = Library()
        
        book1 = Book("To Kill a Mockingbird", "Harper Lee")
        book2 = Book("1984", "George Orwell")
        
        library.add_book(book1)
        library.add_book(book2)
        
        library.display_available_books()
        
        library.borrow_book("1984")
        library.display_available_books()
        
        library.return_book("1984")
        library.display_available_books()
        ```
